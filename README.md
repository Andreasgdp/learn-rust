# learn rust

This is a simple project to learn rust. I am following the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

It is simply for me to learn the language and to have a reference for future projects, but if you find it useful, feel free to use it.

## How to run

To run the project, you need to have rust installed. You can install it by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
